The Git repository does not come with FFmpeg binaries due to their file size. This project uses `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe`.

You can download the binaries from
https://github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg/releases the currently (18.04.2023) used version is  
[`Codex FFmpeg v5.1.2-full_build`](https://github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg/releases/tag/5.1.2)

Alternatively, you may download the latest version at https://github.com/Zeratoxx/Drag-n-Compress/releases, there are the same binaries available.
